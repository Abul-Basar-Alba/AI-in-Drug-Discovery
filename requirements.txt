# NOTE: RDKit is not included here because binary wheels are platform-specific
# and often not available via pip. If you need RDKit, install it separately
# using conda: `conda install -c conda-forge rdkit` or follow your OS package
# manager instructions. The featurizers include a non-RDKit fallback.
